# Assignment-Three

What requirements did I achieve, which did I not, what was difficult?

- Rather than anser these questions separately, I'll answer them all together. I think it's best to preface this my answers by saying I found this exceptionally difficult and have been having trouble with JavaScript for a while now. To begin with, I believe the only requirement I actually met was the that of the interval/timer that counted the increase in cookies, and even now, I have forgotten how I did it. All the others, were simply out of my grasp, and the only way I could accomplish them at the moment would be by stripping code directly from AI, which of course would be pointless. Although I have to admit that I relied on AI quite heavily for the JavaScript portion of this assignment (which is obviously most of it) - I simply do not understand how to write JavaScript, it makes pretty much no sense to me and I require assistance with this.

Additional comments I'd like to add:

- I'd like to reiterate that I have fallen behind (at least in my view) in regards to proficiency with JavaScript comparatively with the rest of the cohort. I've found it quite difficult to concentrate these past couple of weeks as I have been experiencing a flare up of my autoimmune disease, and have been in quite a bit of pain. I understand I will get a low mark for this assignment and that is fine, I just want some help going through JavaScript during self-reflection hours if possible. Rather than continue with this assignment now, where I would be fully plagiarising code from ChatGPT, I feel it is more useful for me to try to revise basic JS content such as Loops, Arrays, Callback etc. and then watch recordings from previous lessons on APIs and the like.
